  <p>The first impression is equal parts aggression and elegance. The new front end for ‘71 gave each of the quad headlights an individual style, and the front grille was far more pronounced. It was the perfect mixtures of European and American styles, almost like if a Z/28 Camaro mated with a Jaguar XJ6. Plus, the black vinyl roof and well integrated rear bumper are timeless symbols of premium design. But this coupe is far from just a luxury machine. The factory-correct Cardinal Red has a bold presence that gets your heart pumping. Plus, this has all the right aggression with the correct GTO badging, creased fenders, and large hood scoops that could inhale anything that gets in their way. And no great Pontiac is complete without out the Rally II wheels with PMD center caps.
  You paid a bit more to upgrade to a Pontiac back in the day, and you can instantly tell why when you open the door. The design of the black bucket seats with comfort weave insert offer equal parts style and coziness. The dark vinyl matches the door panels, carpets, and center armrest, but the interior is not a monochromatic experience. There is wood appliqué’ on the center console, three-spoke steering wheel, and surrounding the gauge cluster. Plus, Pontiac’s performance cars feature a section of billet aluminum trim for some nice standout aggression within this luxury. And while this looks like a pristine factory package, keen eyes will spot some upgrades like an AM/FM/cassette stereo with digital tuner, and provisions for air conditioning.
  These GTOs came with the big 400 cubic-inch V8, and the block even decodes period correct. That’s why this one wears the correct Pontiac Turquoise paint with pride, and even has a period-correct four-barrel carburetor. 1971 was still in the prime of the muscle car era, so Pontiac rated this big V8 at as much as 350 hp right out of the box. That’s why the motor fires up with an angry growl out of the quad pipe dual exhaust. While the TH400 three-speed transmission and 12-bolt rear end is part of a stout factory package, there’s much more to this coupe. After all, the automatic gearbox, power steering, and front disc brakes also make this an easy any time cruiser.
